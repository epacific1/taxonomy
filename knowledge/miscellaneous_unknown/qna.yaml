      This is the handbook for the Ansible Partner Engineering Team.
      It lives in GitHub because this is where we work, and because the
      review process is how we work.
      The handbook is inspired by the [Gitlab handbook]
      (https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/).
      It contains information about how we work as a team,
      and is guided by a few high level principles.
      * Provide the best partner experience
